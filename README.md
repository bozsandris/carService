# Car Service Application - Backend
Web application for managing car services, written in React & Spring, made for practice purposes.

Core features:
- Register your car for service
- Track the status of your car online after you took it to the service (Parts needed, cost of service, estimated progress)
- Mechanics can manage the service status of the car (Add/remove car parts, change issue and progress, or just simply delete the repair)

Planned features:
- Email verification on registration
- User management for admins (Add and revoke mechanic role)
- Verification of car registration, so that it does not instantly appear on the lists until it's manually accepted for service by a mechanic
- Email notification about changed service status and about appointments (when to deliver and take the car)
- More to come
